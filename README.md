# Cpp-tasks
Collection of mandatory assignments for the C++ course
## Exercise 1: Basic Cpp
  Using cout, cin and filestream to read temperatures from input and file, categorize the temperatures and print number of temperatures in each category. 
## Exercise 2: Pointers and references
  4 tasks explaining the difference between pointers and references, and showing how doing operations with them changes their value <br>
  * Task 1: Doing operations on pointers and references. Printing the values.
  * Task 4: Fixing illegal syntax
  * Task 5: Three different ways of assigning value to a variable
  * Task 6: Using a pointer in a table to iterate through an interval and printing the sum
## Exercise 3: Object oriented programming
Tasks relating to using classes in cpp
* Circle: Fixing the syntax of a class with the corrected errors in comments. The class is for a circle with methods for finding area and circumference.
* Commodity: Show how you can use classes from other files using cpp and header files. 
* Task 4: Exercises using the string-class. Modifying parts of the string and check if the string contains a certain word. Uses methods like size(), substr(), and find().
## Exercise 4: Vectors, auto and lambda
* Task1: Placing numbers in a vector and using a method do determine of the numbers exists in the vector.
* Task2: Gtkmm example
## Exercise 5: Polymorphism and smart pointers
Chessboard using polymorphism for chess pieces. Printing the chessboard after each move.
## Exercise 6: Function Objects and threads
* Task 1: Added the class "ChessBoardPrint" to the chessboard program in Exericse5. Moved all prints to this class using function objects
* Task 2: Web-server that responds to HTTP GET-requests
## Exercise 7: Operator overloading
* Fraction: Used operator overloading to make it possible to use the standard operators on fractions with oher fractions and integers using "+" and "-"
* Set: Used operator overloading to use "+" on a Set class and using the construcor to make a union of two Sets.
## Exercise 8: Templates
Using Templates to make functions that can take multiple datatypes as parameters for the function. 
* Equal: The equal() function can take both double and integer
* Pair: Template class Pair only uses headerfile. Makes it possible to make pairs of double and intefers, compare them and print them using operator overloading.
## Exercise 9: STL-algorithms
Examples of Find_if() and replace_copy_if, and using lambda and predicates to determine if two vectors are roughly equal or if the number should be replaced with 100
## Exercise 10: 3rd party libraries
A game using 3rd party libraries
